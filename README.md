### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description
The project provides summary statistics of bike share data for three city Chicago, New York and Washington.

### Description
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

    Most popular month
    Most popular day
    Most popular hour
    Most popular start station
    Most popular end station
    Most popular combination of start and end stations
    Total trip duration
    Average trip duration
    Types of users by number
    Types of users by gender (if available)
    The oldest user (if available)
    The youngest user (if available)
    The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
